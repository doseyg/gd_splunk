Various Splunk apps I wrote to do things I needed to do.
- **whois** Lookup an domain name or IP address using whois and add the whois data to the entries in Splunk 
- **enrich_misp** Send the contents of a field from Splunk to a MISP instance and add the returned MISP data to the entires in Splunk.
